OVERALL
- fully check db_ops (inserting and checking prs)
- fully check GUI functionality (empty fields and marshalling)
- fully check data visualization and dates functionality
- finalize caching system
- add table into GUI to display data (using pyQT) ... use for editting/deleting?
- pretty up (optional)

BUGS
- can only assume date range in cache is 1 continuous range iff we only allow cache to grow if new query is adjacent, otherwise clear it and begin new
	- case where use will ahve two non-adjacent date ranges is rare
- refresh dates seems to query twice for each active axis. second query only looks at cache (which is how it should work), but why query at all?

SPECIFIC
- execute bugs ^
- get on data point to left / right of graph edges so trend lines extend to edge (how?)
- allow refined session graph plots
    ex: optional in/out filter, location filter
- change values of y-axis to letter grades if session (i.e. 11.75 --> 5.11d OR 7 --> v7)
	- also show units is weight
		- toggle between lbs/kgs?
- fix x-axis labels (recheck granularities)
    - 10 days is bad
