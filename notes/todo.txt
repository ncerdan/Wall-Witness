OVERALL
-fully check db_ops (inserting and checking prs)
-use pyQT to create GUI for adding entries that uses db_ops functions to update database
-create table in GUI (or something simple) to know if it works properly
-use matplotlib / more pyQT to have user select data w menu and have it displayed in graph
-pretty up (optional)

SPECIFIC
-remove calls to getUiType() in launch_dialog? it doesn't seem needed.
