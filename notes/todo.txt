OVERALL
- fully check db_ops (inserting and checking prs)
- fully check GUI functionality (empty fields and marshalling)
- add table into GUI to display data (using pyQT) ... use for editting/deleting?
- use matplotlib / more pyQT to have user select data w menu and have it displayed in graph
- caching?
- pretty up (optional)

SPECIFIC
- allow refined session graph plots
    ex: optional in/out filter, location filter
- change values of y-axis to letter grades if session (i.e. 11.75 --> 5.11d OR 7 --> v7)
- x-axis labels good? (m/d and m/y too similar?)
- add reset button for dates in case user looses data out of window
