allow ability to add workouts (think squats, max pullups, etc)
make location a drop down with ^addition functionality^ for future filtering?
show graph of progress on bottom with menu to show what y axis is showing (left AND right axis?)
    set max and min value of axis to be +/- 5(?) of max/min values respectively
show tables of data on right w tabs above to choose collection viewing (for editing?)
delete functionality (using tables?)
update/edit button (also using tables?)
add manual caching from server
    if cached when updating/adding entry -> update / clear cache (then relod graph?)
    otherwise cache still valid

    if updating date just need to query for new data (if any)
