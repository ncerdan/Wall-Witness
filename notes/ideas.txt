allow ability to add workouts (think squats, max pullups, etc)
make location a drop down with ^addition functionality^ for future filtering?
set max and min value of axis to be +/- 5(?) of max/min values respectively
show tables of data on right w tabs above to choose collection viewing (for editing?)
delete functionality (using tables?)
update/edit button (also using tables?)

add manual caching from server
    if cached when updating/adding entry -> update / clear cache (then reload graph?)
    otherwise cache still valid -- no need to change

    if updating date, just need to query for new data (if any)

have dynamic table title to describe what the axis are?
    - or are combo boxes enough?
